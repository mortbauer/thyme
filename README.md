## Running your own instance

1. Clone the repository, navigate to the created folder, and run `npm install`.
2. Use `npm build` to build the application. Assets will be available in `build/`.
3. Change the location of [Thyme Capsule](https://github.com/ThymeApp/thyme-capsule) by setting the `REACT_APP_API_ROOT` environment variable before building.
4. Run `npx serve build` to serve your build on localhost.

## Building browser extensions

1. Follow the steps for running your own instance.
2. Use `npm run build:extensions` to compile and zip the browser extensions.

## Generating sample data

To generate sample data to be used for development, or just to clean your development state, you can
use the following command:

```
npm run generate-sample
```

This will create a new file called `sample.json` in the root of the project. Use the "Export / Import data"
section of the settings page to import the sample data.

## Development

You can help out with development using the following steps.

1. Clone the repository, navigate to the created folder, and run `npm install`.
2. Copy the staging environment variables to a local version `cp .env.staging .env.local`. Adjust if needed.
3. Open a development server by executing `npm start`.
4. Find source files for the app in `./src`.
